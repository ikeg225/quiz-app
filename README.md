# Sports Quiz Application

This is the repo for the quiz software that [Sports Quiz](https://sportsquiz.org) uses. This application was built from scratch using MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, and NodeJS (MERN).

## Play a Quiz

In order to play a quiz, a search parameter is needed. This is done by adding "?search=ENTER_QUIZ_HERE" to the url "quizzes.sportsquiz.org". For example, in order to play the Lakers quiz, the url would be [https://quizzes.sportsquiz.org/?search=lakers](https://quizzes.sportsquiz.org/?search=lakers).\
Users are not expected to use this method of finding quizzes. They will first be directed to quiz landing pages and then click a button that links to a quiz.
